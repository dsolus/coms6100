\section{General Remarks}
\paragraph{} The Lecture notes submitted by the class have been very good. Integer division seemed to be a common oversight when working the Fortran II assignment. However, questions and discussion about the howework assignment will be addressed after everyone has submitted it.\\

\section{Fortran: Loops}
\subsection{Loops Exercise}

\paragraph{} To begin, we reworked the in class coding assignment that ended last lecture. The exercise allows us to practice using loops in fortran. This exercise should be easy now that everyone has worked on the homework assignment.\\

\par There is almost always a cleaner, better, or at least different way to do things. Keep this in mind as you begin to work more complicated problems.\\
