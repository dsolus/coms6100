#Results
 single precision, forward sum:    15.4036827      (after loop)
 single precision, backward sum:    18.8079185      (after loop)
 double precision, forward sum:    21.300481573265063       (after loop)
 double precision, backward sum:    21.300481567973723       (after loop)

#Explanation of results
Looking at the numbers for the single precision summations it is clear that the
backward summation is more precise. I suppose this is to be expected as the 
summation does not begin with one. However I am not completely sure why this is
the case. For the double precision calulations the results are nearly identical
but again the backward summation is slightly different. I assume it is the more
precise measurement simply based on the results of the single precision
calculations.
